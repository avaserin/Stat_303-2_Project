    "abstract: _This report aims to develop the most accurate predictions of fuel efficiency in miles per gallon of cars based on their features. We developed a multiple linear regression that optimizes the R-squared and RMSE values through forward stepwise selection. We constructed multiple linear regression models with all numerical first-order predictors, improving upon the model with variable transformations as well as variable selection and regularization techniques such as best subset selection, forward stepwise selection, lasso, and ridge regression. Ultimately, our final model was the one created with forward stepwise selection. This model has two first-order predictors (weight, model_year) and four interaction terms (horsepower_acceleration, weight_model_year, acceleration_model_year, horsepower_weight) along with an R-squared value of 0.891 and an RMSE of 2.824. Based on this model, stakeholders should pay close attention to horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model_year in regards to fuel efficiency and environmental efforts. That being said, stakeholders should be aware that our model may grow obsolete with time as new models of cars are developed in the 21st century_.\n",

    "There are 65 million multi-vehicle households in the United States, each of which drives about 28,000 miles per year. If each one reduced fuel consumption by 10%, we would need 10 billion fewer gallons of gasoline per year. Assuming 3.5 dollars per gallon, we’d save $35 billion in fuel costs. We would also prevent 100 million metric tons of tailpipe CO2 emissions, equivalent to taking almost 20 million cars off the road [3].  Besides CO2, car fuel also creates harmful byproducts like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, benzene, and formaldehyde [2]. These greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cars account for about 27% of total greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions [1]. EPA programs exist to reduce carbon pollution from transportation by cutting GHG emissions and increasing fuel efficiency. Based on these recommendations from the EPA, we aim to create a model to predict fuel efficiency based on various car metrics, allowing for lower fuel costs and less greenhouse gas emissions. \n",

Based on the results of our data analysis, we can inform car manufacturers about important factors they should focus on when producing more environmentally friendly cars. These results will benefit car users because customers will know which factors matter more when they are looking to purchase cars. Lastly, this project will benefit environmental policy activists because they will be able to target specific car features when deciding on policies and laws to decrease carbon emissions. We recognize that cars and their environmental impact affect a large majority of the population, but we wanted to narrow our stakeholders down to these three key groups."

A similar error caused us to originally believe our ridge regression was the best model, when in actuality our forward selection model was the most optimal. As such, the first model we tried did not work – we had to experiment with transformations and subset selection to optimize our performance metrics.\n",
